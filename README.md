This project is a journaling app where users can write whatever is on their mind. The app was written in SwiftUI. Uses Core Data to save all the entries to iCloud. The app syncs between iOS, macOS, watchOS, and VisionOS. 

Every entry is unique and every entry and be placed into to various topics. The topics are created the user. 

When the user wants to create an entry they are taken to the entry view. The view consists of name, modification date, status (if they want to keep it open or close it) the Topic and it can be place in multiple topics and as well as an area for the user to write into.  There are also reminders per entry to tell the user to come back and continue working or reminder to just write every day. 

The user can search their entries based on the most recent created entry, by all entries or by topic. 

There are rewards for the user depending on how much they interact with the app. 

The app requires device authentication depending on the device. For example, on iOS it uses Face ID. If that is not available, it defaults to the devices passcode. 

The app has widgets created to check out highest priority entry or add and edit various entries.
